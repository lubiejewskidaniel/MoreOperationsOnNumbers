/*
The program asks the user to input an integer number between 1 and 20 and then gives the user the option to choose from three calculations to be performed on that number. The options are:

a. Sum of odd numbers from 1 to the user's chosen number
b. Sum of even numbers from 1 to the user's chosen number
c. Sum of odd and even numbers from 1 to the user's chosen number.

The code then calculates and outputs the results based on the user's choice. If the user inputs a number outside the range of 1 and 20, they are prompted to enter another number. The program uses while loops nad do/while loop instead of for loops to perform the calculations.

Also program uses <math.h> library to round decimal to nearest integers.
